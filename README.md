## Predict whether a Customer Review is positive or negative using Naive Bayes Classifier and NLP

### About this project

We will use a dataset to train the model with a dataset which has two columns. One column has the review, other has a 0 or 1 which indicates whether it is a positive or a negative review. We will then use the trained model to predict whether a review is positive or negative.

We have used Naive Bayes as a classifier here, but we can try with other types of classifiers also.
